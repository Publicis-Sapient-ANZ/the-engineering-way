# Publicis Sapient

Publicis Sapient is a global consultancy and part of the Publicis Groupe.  We are the Australian based engineering arm of the business and here we aim to showcase the kind of work we do and the activities we get up to.

We offer a full spectrum of engineering consulting services and this space is intended to expose some of the skills and expertise we have publicly and to our engineering colleagues across the industry.  Here you will find examples of the kind of skills we can offer, get an idea of what it is like to work with Sapient engineering and find our contributions to the wider open source community.

This repository is the work of the Publicis Sapient ANZ Engineering team. We are a fast growing team of passionate technologists, with aspirations of further high growth over the next three years.  At the moment we have offices in Melbourne and Sydney and we have expanded with staff located in Canberra, Perth, Brisbane and Auckland.  If you have any questions about Sapient engineering, what it is like to work with us or what we are building at the moment then please do not hesitate to get in touch!
