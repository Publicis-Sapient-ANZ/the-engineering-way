# Engineering the Sapient Way.

A [PS](who-we-are.md) engineer working for an Australian project:

* Has responsibilities to their team – mentor, coach, and lead.
* Knows engineering the Sapient way. Follows the Sapient way. Fixes it if it is broken. If they find a better way, they copy it and extend. If somebody could use it, they share it.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviours we desire both interpersonally and technically.
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

## Why have the Sapient Way?

* To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general.
* Reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
* Strive to be a better engineer and learn from other people's shared experience.
* To provide customers with the better engineering outcomes
* To codify our engineering culture and share it with all.
* The Sapient way is our engineering culture codified. Without it we're not adding much significant value over a generic staffing agency.


## "The" Basics

If you do nothing else follow the [Engineering Basics](engineering-basics.md)! It's here to help you get started on this journey.

## General Guidance

* Keep the code quality bar high.
* Value quality and precision over ‘getting things done’.
* Work diligently on the one important thing.
* As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams and backlog items.
* Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow.
* Avoid adding scope to a backlog item, instead add a new backlog item.
* Our goal is to ship incremental customer value.
* Keep backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team.
* Report product issues found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback!
* We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great.

This is our Sapient Way. All contributions welcome! Please feel free to submit a [pull request]() to get involved.

This guide was inspired by the work done by the Microsoft CSE team here:https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/ and extended by the good folks of Publicis Sapient.
